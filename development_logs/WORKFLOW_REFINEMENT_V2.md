# Workflow Refinement V2

## Changes Made

### 1. Refined Stage 1 Workflow

**Old Workflow** (7 tools):
```
start_draft_generation
  ↓
context_gatherer (analyze everything)
  ↓
title_thinker (think about title)
  ↓
generate_title (get prompt)
  ↓
commit_title (confirm title)
  ↓
content_thinker (think about content)
  ↓
generate_content
  ↓
commit_draft
```

**New Workflow** (6 tools):
```
start_draft_generation(query)
  ↓
intention_identifier(proposed_title, reasoning)
  → Identifies what user really wants
  → Proposes title FIRST based on conversation
  ↓
context_gatherer(title, gathered_context)
  → Gathers context FOR the specific title
  → Focused extraction of relevant details
  ↓
content_thinker(title, content_structure, key_points)
  → Plans how to structure the content
  ↓
generate_content()
  ↓
commit_draft(content)
```

### 2. Key Improvements

#### A. Title First Approach
- **Old**: Gather everything → then decide title → then generate content
- **New**: Identify intention & propose title → gather FOR that title → generate content
- **Benefit**: Title becomes the organizing principle from the start

####  B. Handles "Conversation-as-Card" Pattern
When the entire conversation IS the card:
- Old workflow: Hard to distill what the conversation was about
- New workflow: `intention_identifier` explicitly asks "what is this conversation really about?"

#### C. Focused Context Gathering
- **Old**: `context_gatherer` analyzed everything broadly
- **New**: `context_gatherer` receives the proposed title and gathers specifically for it
- **Benefit**: More focused, less redundant

#### D. Reduced Tool Count
- **Old**: 8 Stage 1 tools (including title generation sub-steps)
- **New**: 6 Stage 1 tools (title is proposed in one step)
- **Benefit**: Simpler, more direct workflow

### 3. Removed Emojis

All response templates now use clean, professional language:

**Before**:
```
✅ Draft generation workflow started!
📝 **Title Generation Prompt**
🔍 Title Reflection Complete
❌ Error: Title cannot be empty
```

**After**:
```
Draft generation workflow started.
**Title Generation Prompt**
Title reflection complete.
Error: Title cannot be empty.
```

## New Tool Definitions

### `intention_identifier`
```
Purpose: Identify user intention and propose title
Parameters:
  - proposed_title: The title that captures what conversation is about
  - reasoning: Why this title represents the core intention

Description: Engage extended thinking to identify what the user really
wants to capture. Analyze the query and conversation context to understand
the core intention, then propose a clear card title that captures what this
conversation is truly about.
```

### `context_gatherer` (refined)
```
Purpose: Gather focused context for the proposed title
Parameters:
  - title: The card title to gather context for
  - gathered_context: Insights, examples, details related to this title

Description: Engage deep thinking to gather relevant context for the
proposed title. Extract insights, examples, arguments, and details from
the conversation that specifically relate to this title. Focus your
analysis on what matters for this particular card.
```

## Workflow Logic

### Why This Is Better

1. **Natural Flow**
   - User query → What do they want? (intention) → Gather details → Write
   - Mirrors how humans think: "What am I writing about?" → Research → Write

2. **Handles Edge Cases**
   - Simple query: "Tell me about X" → Title: "X" → Gather X context
   - Complex conversation: Whole discussion → Distill into title → Extract relevant parts

3. **Less Redundant**
   - Old: Analyze everything (context_gatherer) → Analyze again for title (title_thinker)
   - New: Propose title → Analyze what's relevant to that title

4. **Title as Anchor**
   - Having title early provides clear focus
   - Content generation knows exact scope
   - Context gathering is targeted

## Statistics

| Metric | Old | New | Change |
|--------|-----|-----|--------|
| Stage 1 tools | 8 | 6 | -2 |
| Total tools | 17 | 15 | -2 |
| Title generation steps | 3 steps | 1 step | -67% |
| Response emojis | Many | Zero | -100% |

## Tool Flow Comparison

### Old: Multi-Step Title Generation
```
context_gatherer()
  → Analyzes everything

title_thinker(context_summary)
  → Thinks about title possibilities

generate_title()
  → Gets embedded prompt
  → LLM generates title

commit_title(title)
  → Confirms generated title
```
4 steps, title appears late in process

### New: Direct Title Identification
```
intention_identifier(proposed_title, reasoning)
  → Identifies intention
  → Proposes title immediately
  → Explains reasoning
```
1 step, title appears immediately

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Query
```
User: "Create a card about Docker containers"

Old workflow:
1. context_gatherer: "Analyzes Docker concepts broadly..."
2. title_thinker: "Thinks about what aspect of Docker..."
3. generate_title: "Docker Containers for Application Deployment"

New workflow:
1. intention_identifier:
   - Title: "Docker Containers for Application Deployment"
   - Reasoning: "User wants general Docker container knowledge"
2. context_gatherer(title="Docker Containers..."):
   - Gathers: container basics, deployment use cases, benefits
```

### Scenario 2: Conversation-as-Card
```
[Long conversation about MCP design patterns, discussing multiple topics]
User: "Make this a card"

Old workflow:
1. context_gatherer: "Summarizes everything in conversation..."
2. title_thinker: "Tries to identify main theme..."
3. generate_title: Might be too broad or miss the point

New workflow:
1. intention_identifier:
   - Analyzes: "This conversation focused on tool-driven workflows"
   - Title: "MCP Tool Driven Sequential Workflows"
   - Reasoning: "Core theme was using tools to guide execution"
2. context_gatherer(title="MCP Tool Driven..."):
   - Extracts: specific examples of tool chaining, benefits discussed
```

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `responses.py`: Updated all response templates (removed emojis, new workflow)
- `handlers.py`: Replaced title handlers with `intention_identifier` handler
- `server.py`: Updated tool definitions for new workflow
- `handlers.py` registry: Updated tool mapping

### Handlers Changed
- **Removed**: `handle_title_thinker`, `handle_generate_title`, `handle_commit_title`
- **Added**: `handle_intention_identifier`
- **Modified**: `handle_context_gatherer` (new parameters)
- **Modified**: `handle_start_draft_generation` (takes `query` not `topic`)

### Testing Results
- ✓ 15 tools loaded correctly
- ✓ All handlers registered
- ✓ Stage 1 workflow sequence correct
- ✓ Zero emojis in responses
- ✓ All tool definitions valid

## Benefits Summary

1. **Cleaner workflow**: 6 tools instead of 8 for Stage 1
2. **Better focus**: Title-first approach gives clear direction
3. **Professional**: No emojis in system responses
4. **Natural**: Mirrors human thinking (intention → research → write)
5. **Handles edge cases**: Works for both simple queries and complex conversations
6. **Less redundant**: No duplicate analysis steps
