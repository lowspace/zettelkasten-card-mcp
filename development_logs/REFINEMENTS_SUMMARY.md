# Refinements Summary

## Changes Made Based on Feedback

### 1. Template System → Single Template ✅

**Before**: Multiple templates in `templates/` directory with template selection logic
**After**: Single `template.md` file, no selection needed

**Changes**:
- Removed `templates/` directory (kept for backward compatibility, but not used)
- Created single `template.md` in project root
- Removed `template_selector` tool
- Removed `get_available_templates` utility tool
- Updated `config.py` to use `template_file` instead of `templates_directory`
- Simplified `apply_template` tool - no template type parameter needed

### 2. Naming Convention → Timestamp with Hyphen ✅

**Before**: `YYYYMMDD-Core-Concept-With-Hyphens`
**After**: `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS - Card Title With Spaces`

**Format**: `<% tp.date.now("YYYYMMDDHHMMSS") %> - Card Title`
**Example**: `20251022143015 - MCP Tool Driven Sequential Workflow.md`

**Key Points**:
- Timestamp format: `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS` (includes hour, minute, second for uniqueness)
- Separator: ` - ` (space-hyphen-space) - this is the ONLY hyphen
- Title uses natural language with regular spaces
- User generates title only; timestamp added automatically by server

**Changes**:
- Updated `apply_template` to generate timestamp in new format
- Updated filename construction: `f"{timestamp} - {title}.md"`
- Updated prompts to clarify: "do NOT include timestamp"
- Updated naming conventions documentation

### 3. Think Tool Descriptions → Incentivize Reasoning ✅

**Before**: Generic descriptions like "Record your thinking..."
**After**: Explicit calls to engage extended thinking and reasoning

**New Descriptions**:

- **`context_gatherer`**: "_Engage extended thinking to deeply analyze the topic, extract key insights from the conversation, and identify the core concept. This tool helps you think through what matters most before generating title and content._"

- **`title_thinker`**: "_Focus your reasoning on crafting the perfect title. Engage extended thinking to consider what specific aspect of the topic this card captures, how to make it atomic and clear, and what naming best reflects the core idea._"

- **`content_thinker`**: "_Engage deep reasoning about how to structure and present the content. Think through the logical flow, key points to emphasize, examples to include, and how to make the explanation clear and valuable._"

**Purpose**: Explicitly trigger Claude's extended thinking mode for better quality output

### 4. Added `context_gatherer` Node ✅

**New Workflow**:
```
start_draft_generation
  ↓
context_gatherer (NEW)  ← Extract insights BEFORE title/content
  ↓
title_thinker
  ↓
generate_title
  ↓
...
```

**Purpose**:
- Separate context gathering from title/content generation
- Title and content phases can focus purely on generation, not analysis
- Cleaner separation of concerns: analyze → plan → generate

**Parameters**:
- `topic`: The topic to analyze
- `conversation_insights`: Key insights extracted from conversation

### 5. Refined `title_thinker` Scope ✅

**Before**:
- Parameter: `context_summary` (summary of entire conversation)
- Scope: Too broad, covered all conversation context

**After**:
- Parameters: `topic_specifics` + `core_concept`
- Scope: Focused on the specific aspect this card captures

**Rationale**:
- Topic/title may be just a piece of the conversation
- Don't need full conversation summary
- Focus on what makes THIS card unique
- Context gathering already done in previous step

**Updated Parameters**:
```python
"topic_specifics": {
    "description": "Specific information about this particular aspect of the topic, what makes it unique"
},
"core_concept": {
    "description": "The single core concept this card will focus on"
}
```

### 6. Updated `content_thinker` Parameters ✅

**Before**: `title` + `key_points`
**After**: `title` + `content_structure` + `key_points`

**New Parameter**:
```python
"content_structure": {
    "description": "Your thought process on how to structure the content logically"
}
```

**Purpose**: Encourage thinking about logical flow and organization, not just listing points

## Final Tool Count

- **Total**: 17 tools (was 18)
- **Stage 1**: 8 tools (was 7, added context_gatherer)
- **Stage 2**: 9 tools (was 11, removed template_selector and get_available_templates)

## Configuration Changes

**config.yaml**:
```yaml
# Before
templates_directory: "./templates"

# After
template_file: "./template.md"
```
